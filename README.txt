This is a small program that I created as a small personal excersize on the
different types of convex hull algorithms. Convex hull algorithms are very
interesting because they play a huge role in pathing algorithms, something
that autonymous vehicles will depend on. 

To compile these programs, you must be using gcc 4.6.3 or something around
there. This program depends on the posix I/O library, so it must be compiled
on in a Linux environment or something compatible. To compile the program, 
you could enter in the manual gcc commands, or you could just use the provided
make file.
